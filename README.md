## Who

* Naoto Hieda (<http://naotohieda.com>)

## Why

The main idea of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is to control computers/machines with a brain. But, can we control (or instrument) someone's brain?

## How

* EEG sensor
  * g.tec
  * BrainProducts
  * OpenBCI
* EEG acquisition / processing
  * labstreaminglayer
  * OSC
  * python
  * (matlab)
* visualization / sonification
  * openFrameworks
  * Processing
  * Max 7
* stimulus
  * scenarios (open eyes / close eyes / etc)
  * ASSR (Max 7)
  * SSVEP (Processing)

## Ethical considerations

* EEG may be recorded but individual is not identifiable (really?)
* video will be recorded for documentation and is identifiable
* flashing lights (SSVEP)
